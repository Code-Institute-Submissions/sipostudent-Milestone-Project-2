# SIMON â€“ Memory Game

Milestone Project Two / Interactive Frontend Development / Code Institute

This is a simple single-player memory game inspired by SIMON, an electronic game of memory skill. The purpose of the game is to replicate a continually growing sequence of signals which in this rendition is displayed via a synchronised combination of musical tones and animated buttons. To find out more about the SIMON memory game, please see this brief [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yqj76Q4jJ4 "about SIMON") and [Wikipedia](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_(game)> "more about SIMON") entry for both rules and history of the original.
